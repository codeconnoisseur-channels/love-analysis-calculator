Project Assignment: Build a Backend-Only Love Calculator Using Pure Node.js

Objective

Create a backend-only *Love Calculator* that takes two names, simulates a playful love analysis, calculates individual "love scores", computes an average score, and returns a tailored love recommendation.

You must use *only Node.js core modules* — no Express or other frameworks.


What You’ll Build

A Node.js server that:

* Accepts two names via a POST request
* Simulates a love analysis using delayed steps
* Calculates a random score for each name
* Computes the average percentage
* Returns a message based on that average
* Saves the results in two separate files


Functional Requirements

  1. Set Up a Basic HTTP Server

* Use Node’s built-in http module to create the server.
* It should only respond to POST requests at the /calculate endpoint.

2. Accept JSON Data from Postman

* Accept a JSON body with two fields:

  
  {
    "name1": "Alice",
    "name2": "Bob"
  }
  

 3. Simulate Multi-Step Analysis

Use setTimeout() to fake a fun love analysis:

* After 1 second: Log “Calculating compatibility...”
* After 2 seconds: Log “Analyzing hearts...”
* After 3 seconds: Log “Generating result...”

4. Generate Individual Love Scores

* Generate a *random score between 0 and 100 for each name*.
* Calculate the *average* of both scores.

 5. Return a Tailored Recommendation

Use the *average score* to determine the final message:

| Average Score | Recommendation                 |
| ------------- | ------------------------------ |
| 0–30          | Uh-oh... Maybe stay friends    |
| 31–60         | There's potential. Keep trying |
| 61–85         | You both are a great match     |
| 86–100        | Perfect soulmates              |


Example Output (Client Response)


{
  "name1": "Alice",
  "name2": "Bob",
  "score1": 56,
  "score2": 78,
  "average": 67,
  "message": "You both are a great match"
}


Save Results to Files

Store each analysis result in **two ways**:

 1. `results.json`

Append each record as a structured JSON object:


{
  "name1": "Alice",
  "score1": 56,
  "name2": "Bob",
  "score2": 78,
  "average": 67,
  "message": "You both are a great match"
}


 2. results.txt

Append a human-readable summary like:

Alice scored 56%
Bob scored 78%
Average: 67% - You both are a great match..
